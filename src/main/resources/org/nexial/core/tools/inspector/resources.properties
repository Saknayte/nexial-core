meta.file.missing=No <code>.meta/project.id</code> file found in the specified project directory. While this file \
  is not necessary, it helps to keep everyone in sync in terms of project metadata. For more details, check out \
  <a href="http://nexiality.github.io/documentation/userguide/UnderstandingProjectStructure#project.id" \
  target="_nexial">Project Structure - project.id</a>.

macro.description.missing=One or more macro is found without description. It is recommended for each macro \
  implementation to have some usage documentation, along with the data variable(s) it expects prior to invocation \
  and the data variable(s) it produces after invocation. For more details, please check out \
  <a href="http://nexiality.github.io/documentation/commands/macro/" target="_nexial">Macro Commands</a>.

dv.bad.definition=No value defined for this data variable. This is likely a configuration issue. Check your artifacts \
  across the entire project.

dv.values.same=All defined values for this data variables are the same and hence unnecessary. Consider removing all \
  duplicates and keeping only one definition either in project.properties or #default data sheet.

dv.values.missing=No value specified for this data variable across all instances of definition. If not needed, it may \
  be a good idea to remove this data variable.

dv.value.missing=One or more instances of this data variable is not properly defined. This will likely lead to \
  unexpected result.

dv.values.same.as.default=This System variable is defined with the same value as \
  <a href="#" onclick="return openDocWindow('{name}');">System default</a>, hence is not necessary.

dv.value.encrypt.sensitive=This data variable likely contain sensitive data. As such, it is recommended to obfuscate \
  sensitive information using \
  <a href="https://nexiality.github.io/documentation/userguide/BatchFiles.html#nexial-cryptcmd--nexial-cryptsh" \
  target="_nexial">nexial-crypt</a> as an additional measure of protection.
